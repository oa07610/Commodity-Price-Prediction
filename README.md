# Commodity-Price-Prediction
Pakistan's agricultural sector is extremely significant to the economy of the country and employs a large segment of the population. However, it struggles with the price volatility of key commodities such as wheat, cotton, maize, and rice, which creates uncertainty for crop traders and other stakeholders. The prices of these commodities are affected by factors like weather, demand fluctuations, and global trade, and this fluctuation can lead to financial instability and market inefficiencies. To address this challenge, a robust solution is required which must be capable of forecasting commodity prices with precision.

Our proposed solution is a machine learning-based model designed to predict agricultural commodity prices using a combination of historical data and external variables. By integrating techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and deep learning models (LSTM and GRU), the system will analyze past trends and real-time factors like weather and market conditions. We aim to develop a user-friendly application to incorporate our model, that will provide insights for farmers, traders, and policymakers, enabling better decision-making and minimizing financial risks. 

This project aims to enhance the efficiency of agricultural markets, support the economic stability of rural communities, and contribute to sustainable farming practices by offering a data-driven approach to navigating price fluctuations.
